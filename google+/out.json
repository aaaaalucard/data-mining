This incredible growth is surely one of the most rapid marches to market dominance in history. iOS has also grown substantially from 75m users in Q2 2011 to 232m users in Q3 2013 (19% market share). The big loser is Symbian, which has fallen from a 20% market share to 5% in just two years.

It&#39;s simply us -- and as defective or capable of goodness as we are.<br /><br />&quot;Today, several weeks into the botched launch of Obamacare&#39;s exchanges and several more since the shutdown, the faith of the people in government is weak and weakening further.<br /><br />&quot;This trend long predates Obamacare, and its sources are bipartisan. Democrats who favor more active government have tolerated an ever-more complex and impersonal state, while Republicans who want to shrink government love to showcase the breakdowns that complexity -- and GOP-led underfunding -- can bring.<br /><br />&quot;What&#39;s striking, though, is that both sides have learned to see and speak of government the same way -- as a disembodied thing, a mechanism separate from citizens.<br /><br />&quot;Democrats tend to forget and Republicans like to deny the simple reality that government is nothing more than our best attempt to do certain things together that we can&#39;t do alone. Like ensure that we are all insured against health catastrophes. Or keep toxic foods out of our babies&#39; mouths. Or send humans to the moon. Or design smart transportation systems on Earth.<br /><br />&quot;When government fails, the proper response isn&#39;t fatalism; it&#39;s activism.&quot;\ufeff",

But false accounts can be political tools as well. In 2011, thousands of fake accounts disrupted anti-Kremlin protesters on Twitter.<br /><br />The fake accounts remain a cloud over Twitter Inc. in the wake of its successful initial public offering. &#39;Twitter is where many people get news,&#39; says Sherry Turkle, director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. &#39;If what is trending on Twitter is being faked by robots, people need to know that.

This is a management problem, and a cultural problem. The preferred method for implementing large technology projects in Washington is to write the plans up front, break them into increasingly detailed specifications, then build what the specifications call for. It\u2019s often called the waterfall method, because on a timeline the project cascades from planning, at the top left of the chart, down to implementation, on the bottom right.<br /><br />&quot;Like all organizational models, waterfall is mainly a theory of collaboration. By putting the most serious planning at the beginning, with subsequent work derived from the plan, the waterfall method amounts to a pledge by all parties not to learn anything while doing the actual work. Instead, waterfall insists that the participants will understand best how things should work before accumulating any real-world experience, and that planners will always know more than workers.<br /><br />&quot;This is a perfect fit for a culture that communicates in the deontic language of legislation. It is also a dreadful way to make new technology. If there is no room for learning by doing, early mistakes will resist correction. If the people with real technical knowledge can\u2019t deliver bad news up the chain, potential failures get embedded rather than uprooted as the work goes on.&quot;\ufeff",

He was introduced to me by <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/105847419267701979492\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"105847419267701979492\">Mitch Kapor</a></span>\u00a0as an up-and-coming administration official. His email address was toddy <a href=\"mailto:park@xxxxx.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">park@xxxxx.com</a>, and I thought &quot;I&#39;m not sure who this Toddy Park guy is, but I&#39;m not sure an adult who calls himself Toddy can really be an administration official that&#39;s taken seriously&quot;<br /><br />I came to realize later, that Todd&#39;s middle initial is Y. \u00a0Over the next few years, I worked closely with Todd Park, he helped inspire Sunlight&#39;s most successful apps contest: Design for America, and after years of hearing me moan about the procurement process, gave me a challenge: come in and try and fix it. Be one of the first presidential innovation fellows, and head up RFP-EZ, a program that ended up getting 250 new small businesses registered with the Federal Government and more than paid for itself with a 30% reduction in average bid price.<br /><br />When I first met Todd, he weighed about 60 pounds more than he weighed now. And not because he&#39;s a dieter, but because he&#39;s basically sacrificed everything he can for this country. There&#39;s not an hour of the day that I&#39;ve not received an email from Todd -- he works around the clock.<br /><br />Todd just got subpoenaed by Congressman Darrell Issa today and accused of lying to the american public. I don&#39;t believe Todd has the mental capacity to lie -- not because he isn&#39;t smart, but because he doesn&#39;t have the cognitive energy to expend on it -- he has better things to do.<br /><br />But the real shame of this, is that a member of Congress (and a chairman of a very important congressional committee) has a deep desire to get as close to the president as he can, so that he can mount a trophy on his wall, instead of being of service to his constituents and trying to make government more efficient, fix what&#39;s broken and solve problems. The spirit of Issa is one of politics and vengeance. This is what&#39;s wrong with Washington.\u00a0<br /><br />That&#39;s the opposite of the spirit of Todd. If the people in government technology were made up of characters in the marvel universe, Todd Park would most assuredly be Captain America -- someone who selflessly serves, has a strong moral compass, and has an uncanny ability to always be optimistic and see the best in everyone.<br /><br />We simply cannot allow for the spirit of Issa to trump the spirit of Todd. It isn&#39;t acceptable.\u00a0<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/fabx5f858nhcmuf/parksupoena.pdf\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fabx5f858nhcmuf/parksupoena.pdf</a>\ufeff",

I am not American, I am a Brit, but it&#39;s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.<br /><br />We designed this system to <b>keep criminals out</b>. There&#39;s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we&#39;ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system <b>is illegal for a good reason</b>.<br /><br />Unfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, \u00a0we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.<br /><br />Thank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\ufeff",

    "content": "<b>Why Government Investment Makes Sense Now</b><br /><br />I was interested to see what appears to be a Libertarian-leaning author making the case for government spending in the face of the current worldwide economic situation. \u00a0Frankly, I wish the US and Europe were investing a lot more in infrastructure right now, and putting idle resources to work on stuff that matters while credit is still cheap. \u00a0We&#39;ll still have to do that stuff later on, when it will be more expensive, because by then the government will be competing with the private sector for resources.<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />&quot;Governments particularly in Britain and the Eurozone have attempted to fight depressed growth using austerity policies (in the context of expansionary monetary policy). The proponents of austerity theorise that by promising to bring down taxes and spending, they will unleash private sector spending by reducing future expectations of taxes. To me, this has always seemed like a boneheaded and Rube Goldberg-style approach. Simply, the issue of depressed private economic activity is far more complex than future taxation expectations. And aggressive monetary policy has not succeeded in reversing the depression (even if it has probably made the depression less severe). So it has been entirely unsurprising to me to see this approach largely failing. I approach the problem in a far more direct manner. The solution to lowered growth and elevated (and involuntary) unemployment is relatively simple.Eventually someone will start using up the idle resources. This will either be the private sector once it independently gets over its slump in animal spirits, or it will be the government. With such huge volumes of idle capital, interest rates will remain very low until stronger appetite for credit re-emerges. In equilibrium theory, the low cost of credit will by itself start to re-energise borrowing appetite by making more projects potentially profitable. Of course, interest rates are far from the only factor that borrowers take into account when seeking credit, and so it is perfectly plausible that the economy \u2014 as it has done \u2014 can remain depressed even with very low rates due to deleveraging pressures, low expectations and low confidence, etc. So if the market is ill-suited to taking up the idle resources any time soon \u2014 lying as it is in a depressive, irrational strop \u2014 the only agent that can do so is the state. The fact of low interest rates allows this to kill two birds with one stone \u2014 the state can borrow money (utilising idle capital) to create jobs (utilising idle labour), raising interest rates and bringing down the unemployment rate. And this approach does not require anyone to make accurate predictions about the future. It simply requires a market economy, and a state willing to employ idle resources when they are idle, and to ease off using idle resources when unemployment becomes low and interest rates start to rise.<br /><br />&quot;Many \u2014 including probably Hayek himself \u2014 would argue that using up idle resources in such a manner will not allow the structure of production to adjust to the new economic reality. The state, Hayek would argue is a poor allocator of capital because it lacks the informational efficiency of the market. I would mostly agree with Hayek\u2019s objection, and note that I favour a predominantly market-based economy. Government interventions should be kept to a necessary minimum. Yet, in a depressionary environment, the structure of production deteriorates as resources lie idle. Unemployed workers lose skills, lose competitive edge and spend and invest less, further depressing the economy. Capital \u2014 factories, buildings, amenities, ideas, etc \u2014 deteriorates. Young workers may enter the labour force but never find a job. Crime rises, and shady fringe businesses like loan sharks thrive as the unemployed struggle to pay the bills. The social costs of mass unemployment are exceedingly high. The adjustment occurring in a depression is more like a rot. And it is absurd to rot your way to growth. Instead, by lowering unemployment and using up idle capital (preferably in a mix of state-run infrastructure and technology projects, and lending to new businesses) more businesses can be born into existence. Potentially successful new ideas can be tried out, and may find success in the marketplace. The formerly unemployed get to develop skills, habits and ideas, instead of sitting at home all day doing nothing, or hunting for jobs in a scarce and depressed marketplace. And money will go into people\u2019s pockets, spurring investment and consumption, fomenting more new business growth. This, in my view, is the best shot at getting a depressed and rotten structure of production out of the doldrums and back toward strong organic growth. Sooner or later, of course, the private sector will come back and begin to use up resources. But that could be a very, very, very long way away. If we want the structure of production to adjust to the new world and to continue adjusting as the world continues to change, letting huge quantities of resources sitting idle seems like a bad way to do it. Targeted fiscal policy can change that.\ufeff",

In the anthology, contemporary authors were asked to reflect on documents from the time.<br /><br />Heaney chose a poem by British poet Edward Thomas, &quot;As the Team&#39;s Head Brass,&quot; which is also reproduced in the article. It is even more poignant than Heaney&#39;s commemoration of it. \u00a0Through a conversation with a farmer plowing a field, Thomas&#39; poem reflects on the emptiness of Britain, whose men went off to war and never came back. \u00a0Thomas himself joined their ranks shortly after writing his poem, and died in France the following year.<br /><br />The poems \u00a0reminded me of the plaque on one of the columns in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that never fails to bring tears to my eyes when I visit it. \u00a0It reads:<br /><br />TO THE MEMORY OF ONE MILLION MEN OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918, AND OF WHOM THE GREATER PART REST IN FRANCE<br /><br />One million men! \u00a0And that&#39;s just the Brits, Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Indians, and others from the British Empire. \u00a0Never mind the French, the Germans, and (in World War II, even more destructive though less pointless, the Jews, the Russians, and the Poles).<br /><br />It is good to remember that tumultuous time, and to reflect on how easy it is for things to go awry, for the human world to spin out of control into darkness. \u00a0But even more important, we can use this opportunity to reflect on\u00a0how little we have been asked to spend of our courage, our passion, and our lives confronting the great issues of our day.\ufeff",

We took a group lesson - with an age range from four to 86 - and as you can see, a splendid time was had by all. Our instructor and guide, Aurelia, was knowledgeable, patient, and a great teacher.<br /><br />What was most astonishing to me is how lightly a falcon lands on your wrist. It&#39;s like a breath of air, so light and controlled that if your eyes were closed, you might not be sure it had happened.<br /><br />My pictures were mediocre, and so I didn&#39;t bother sharing them. These, which I just got from my fellow grandparents, Australian painter Pamela Griffith (<a href=\"http://www.pamelagriffith.com/\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pamelagriffith.com/</a>) and her husband Ross, are magnificent, and give a sense of what it&#39;s like.<br /><br />Be sure to see the picture of my grandson eye-to-eye with a falcon!\ufeff",

She is a wonderful actress. \u00a0(If you&#39;ve seen either <i>The Help</i> or <i>Fruitvale Station</i>, you will recognize her from those movies, as she bookends both of them with her expressive supporting roles.)<br /><br />&quot;But it&#39;s the less-known actors who are more revelatory. Ahna O&#39;Reilly (who dated Franco for years) is astonishing as Dewey, the only daughter, recalling Sissy Spacek&#39;s performance in Badlands. Jim Parrack was a perennial highlight of mine on True Blood, where he played golden-hearted good old boy Hoyt, and Franco&#39;s use of him here is absolute genius. He brings naturalism and genuine soulfulness to his portrayal of oldest brother Cash. Logan Marshall-Green is the handsome guy from Prometheus, but he&#39;ll always be Ryan&#39;s bad news brother Trey Atwood from The O.C. to me. He made me forget about Trey in this movie by sporting a beard and a sometimes indecipherable accent and reminding me of Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.&quot;\ufeff",

But normal people do not announce that if their spouse does not give in, they will break all the windows in the house.<br /><br />Hard-line House Republicans seem to think that their ability to inflict pain on 800,000 federal workers by furloughing them without pay gives them bargaining chips. The hard-liners apparently believe that their negotiating position is strengthened when they demonstrate that they can wreck American governance.<br /><br />The stakes rise as we approach the debt limit and the risk of default \u2014 which the Treasury Department notes could have an impact like that of the 2008 financial crisis and \u201chas the potential to be catastrophic.\u201d Astonishingly, Republican hard-liners see that potential catastrophe as a source of bargaining power in a game of extortion: We don\u2019t want anything to happen to this fine American economy as we approach the debt limit, so you\u2019d better meet our demands.<br /><br />In this situation, it strikes a false note for us as journalists to cover the crisis simply by quoting each side as blaming the other. That\u2019s a false equivalency.&quot;\ufeff",

This makes it so that it&#39;s harder and much more expensive to build a centralized lobbying shop, and helps long-term members not get so separated from the people that they represent.\u00a0<br /><br />2. Increase the number of districts by 50% -- taking the average number of people that a member represents down to about 300-400k, and making total seats be up at 652.<br /><br />3. Any law governing the way that the executive branch operates or interacts with citizens must also apply to the legislative branch. This means Congress can&#39;t pass a law like FOIA, and make itself exempt from it. Same with procurement, IT, IT Security, hiring, paperwork &quot;reduction&quot; and other regulations.\u00a0<br /><br />4. The FCC should mandate 30 minutes (non-consecutive) of prime-time free air time per candidate on publicly owned airwaves per election (primary, general, runoff, etc). That should be the only allowable airtime from candidates. As presently upwards of 80% of money raised by candidates goes towards these ads, this is a way to do campaign finance reform without having to tackle the citizens united/buckley v. valeo issues. While still tricky, the idea here is: let&#39;s encourage candidates to knock on doors and sit in living rooms, not make phone calls to rich patrons and put terrible advertisements on TV.<br /><br />5. Double the salary of Congress. Make it an attractive job for intelligent, well qualified people, not a job for people who want power, and want to get to the payday of leaving and becoming lobbyists.<br /><br />6. Pay people to run for office. If someone can get, let&#39;s say, 10% of the district they want to run in, to sign a petition saying they should run, government should pay them a stipend (let&#39;s say, $60,000/yr) to run for office. This makes it so people other than millionaires can afford to be members of Congress.<br /><br />And for a bonus, to solve budgetary problems:<br /><br />7. Create some kind of &quot;shared savings&quot; program in the executive branch that allows people who honestly save the government money to get attractive bonuses that can compete with private sector pay. So if, for instance, I am able to take the cost of Sam.gov from $181 Million dollars, down to, say $1.81 million dollars, I should get, let&#39;s say, 1% of that savings.\u00a0\ufeff",

    "content": "<b>How Beautiful Interfaces Create Trust and Loyalty</b><br /><br />Reading Farhad Manjoo&#39;s recent article about Google&#39;s new commitment to design and the difference it is making, I was struck by the word &quot;beauty.&quot; \u00a0Steve Jobs&#39; success at Apple made the word a key part of the strategic business lexicon, and now Google is executing on the beauty game plan. Government needs to learn the same lesson.<br /><br />In particular, I was struck by the parallels between Larry Page&#39;s pursuit of beauty in Google products and White House Deputy CTO Jennifer Pahlka&#39;s assertion that one of the best ways to restore faith in government is to create interfaces to government services that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use. (Jen is also the founder of Code for America.)<br /><br />From POLITICO&#39;s profile of Jen when she went to work for the the White House:<br /><br />&quot;Jennifer Pahlka thinks of a good government website as nothing less than a way to improve democracy. If the site is &#39;simple, beautiful and easy to use, you feel differently about government&#39;&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/50-politicos-to-watch-jennifer-pahlka-94195.html#ixzz2g6FkSUcD\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/50-politicos-to-watch-jennifer-pahlka-94195.html#ixzz2g6FkSUcD</a>)<br /><br />From Manjoo&#39;s article:<br /><br />&quot;With the rise of sleek, portable touch-screen computers--i.e., the rise of Apple--people were now interacting with software in the same hands-on way they do with cars, clothes, appliances, and other physical goods. &quot;Our expectations of the real world began transferring to the virtual world,&quot; [lead designer for Google Search, Jon] Wiley says. Google&#39;s designers needed to address questions that they&#39;d scarcely considered before: How do you feel when you use the product? Is it friendly, exciting, disorienting? Is it beautiful?<br /><br />&quot;The evidence suggested they weren&#39;t meeting those goals. In 2010, Google conducted a series of user tests to find out how people felt about Android. The results were stark: &#39;A lot of people felt that Android was essential to their lives, but they didn&#39;t like Android,&#39; [Android Design Director Matias] Duarte says. The robust abilities of the OS &#39;made them feel small. It wasn&#39;t empowering, but daunting.&#39; The same could be said for other Google products. When you loaded up something made by Google, you were more likely to feel overwhelmed than welcomed.<br /><br />&quot;Page took the two goals, beauty and cohesiveness, and combined them into a single mandate for designers: He called it &#39;One Beautiful Google.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />And the results speak for themselves. \u00a0<br /><br />I&#39;ve often heard a similar notion from Jen -- that contemporary technology has raised the bar for government. When people can get information instantly on their smartphone, when companies like Amazon can have a product on your doorstep in less than a day, when these services are not only powerful but simple, beautiful, and easy to use, government looks even more like a bad bargain.<br /><br />If Barack Obama really wants to restore faith in government, and change the poisonous dialogue in Washington, he could do worse than pay attention to what Larry Page has done at Google, putting beauty and simplicity in government services at the heart of the legacy that his administration will leave the American people.<br /><br />Again, from Manjoo&#39;s article: &quot;While Page has never suggested a single design element, he was crucial to the redesign for the simple reason that he made it a firmwide priority. &#39;Only the CEO can get the entire company to focus on something,&#39; says Wiley.&quot;<br /><br />Disclosure: Jen Pahlka is my fianc\u00e9, and I am on the board of Code for America.\ufeff",

That&#39;s why we make this Shenzhen Map for Makers, in the hope of helping you fully experience Shenzhen in a very short time.\u00a0<br />It is made up of 2 main parts. One is the general information about the maker-related factories in different areas in Shenzhen and the cities near Shenzhen. The other is map of Huaqiangbei, including the featured products in different buildings and the peripheral information such as traffic, diners, shopping centers, accommodations etc.<br />This is the 1st version, and we&#39;d love to improve and update it constantly.

    "content": "<b>What I don&#39;t like about my Tesla Model S</b><br /><br />Everyone loves the Tesla Model S. \u00a0And I agree with most of the hype. It\u2019s a delightful car to drive, with a head-turning design, and all my worries about range have proven to be completely unnecessary. \u00a0(I do have the 85 battery.) \u00a0There are wonderful little grace notes, like the app that tracks the location of the car (which has already saved me once from losing my car in a vast airport parking lot, and let me decide that there was time to run back to the bathroom when being picked up at the airport.) The navigation system (with the tech package) is superb. I love that there\u2019s a small \u201cnext turn\u201d display right behind the steering wheel so you don\u2019t have to look over at the main screen. And the audio volume even goes to 11! :-)<br /><br />But it\u2019s not perfect. In the spirit of being helpful to the designers of future models, I thought I\u2019d list some things that I find less than perfect. \u00a0In no particular order:<br /><br />* If the door isn\u2019t completely shut, the car refuses to lock at all. This means that if your kid doesn\u2019t shut the door hard enough, and you walk away without looking, your car remains unlocked. The first time this happened, my car was rifled through during the night, and anything moveable was taken.<br /><br />* The control panel is so big and lovely, with so many options, that it is really dangerous until you spend the time to learn where everything is. You don\u2019t want to be looking for how to turn on the defroster when you are driving! \u00a0You need to figure out where all the commonly needed options are before you start. \u00a0Once you get used to it, it\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a little alarming at first. Take the time to train your eye and hand!<br /><br />* The bluetooth is flaky. (What bluetooth isn\u2019t?) At times, it works delightfully, automatically switching to my phone when I step into the car in the middle of a call. At worst, though, the entertainment system got totally wedged, thinking it was connected to Audible on my phone, and having that non-working display even overwrite maps and directions. I had to restart the display. (Hold down both buttons on the steering wheel till it reboots.)<br /><br />* The key, lovely as it is - an art object in itself - is designed in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to put on a key-ring with other keys (except with a cord rather than a ring.)<br /><br />* There is no spare tire. \u00a0This is probably OK, but it worries me. And I didn&#39;t realize it till I got the car home. Tesla should do a better job of making this clear, and what to do if you have a flat. (The car can&#39;t be towed, has to go on a flatbed truck.)<br /><br />* Visibility out the back is mediocre.<br /><br />* It gets pretty hot in the way back for kids in the kid seats. (This is a known problem, and they\u2019ve suggested workarounds.)<br /><br />* I miss the little sunglass holder up by the roof that was sported by our Prius.<br /><br />* I\u2019d love if the back-up display drew lines (like in modern sports events) to show me the location of the sides of the car relative to the display. The wide-angle lens takes some getting used to, the car seems wider than I\u2019m used to (not sure whether it is, but it feels that way) and I have a hard time telling how close the wheel is to the kerb or other obstacles.<br /><br />There are probably other things that nag me, but this list will do for now. Just a reminder that no one is perfect...\ufeff",

A wonderful talk by Svante Myrick, 26 year old mayor of Ithaca NY. \u00a0I think my favorite moment is when he talks about a young black man being asked (mistakenly) if he was the Mayor, and how that changed how he felt about himself. He&#39;d been mistaken for a lot of things - a mugger, someone to be scared of, but never someone to look up to, someone in authority.<br /><br />I also love how he tells the story of how many people helped him, and why the myth of the self-made man is destructive. \u00a0<span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110226084017096916822\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"110226084017096916822\">Jennifer Pahlka</a></span>, who shared this with me, pulled out this quote:\u00a0<br /><br />&quot;Why is it important to tell the story that way? What does it matter how we tell our stories? It matters because if we tell the stories the correct way, we get the correct moral from those stories. And when we tell them the wrong way, the way we\u2019ve been telling them for too wrong in this country -- the story of self-made men and great men and women of history -- we\u2019re get the wrong morals, and from the wrong morals we take the wrong actions.&quot;\ufeff",

I have found 10,000 things that do not work.&quot;  I found the original source (and what appears to be a good snopes-like site for investigating quotes, <a href=\"http://quote-investigator.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">quote-investigator.com</a>.  Here&#39;s how the story actually goes (and it&#39;s even better, albeit a little longer), as told by one of Edison&#39;s long time associates, Walter S. Mallory:<br /><br />&quot;I found him at a bench about three feet wide and twelve to fifteen feet long, on which there were hundreds of little test cells that had been made up by his corps of chemists and experimenters. He was seated at this bench testing, figuring, and planning. I then learned that he had thus made over nine thousand experiments in trying to devise this new type of storage battery, but had not produced a single thing that promised to solve the question. In view of this immense amount of thought and labor, my sympathy got the better of my judgment, and I said: \u2018Isn\u2019t it a shame that with the tremendous amount of work you have done you haven\u2019t been able to get any results?\u2019 Edison turned on me like a flash, and with a smile replied: \u2018Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results! I know several thousand things that won\u2019t work.\u2019&quot;<br /><br />The &quot;ten thousand&quot; formulation first appears in 1982.  You&#39;ll notice also that the comment was not made about the light bulb, but about batteries.\ufeff",

And someone had re-shared my Maroon Bells post, and that survived even though Google lost the original.<br /><br />But there&#39;s something odd here, a bug I reported but that no one seems to have figured out. \u00a0(I originally discovered it on the War Memorial post, but just discovered it again on the Maroon Bells post when I googled for it just now, and could only find the re-share, with a note that my original post had been deleted. \u00a0I can assure you it wasn&#39;t deleted by me!))\ufeff",

    "content": "I love the idea here that there are three capitalisms, &quot;Yeoman Capitalism&quot;, &quot;Corporate Capitalism&quot;, and &quot;Supercapitalism,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure I agree entirely with Michael O. Church&#39;s description of each of them. \u00a0<br /><br />His description of Yeoman Capitalism is pretty good - this is the capitalism that Adam Smith wrote about, and it is indeed governed by an invisible hand. When companies are engaged in providing real goods and services to each other, and make money by satisfying the needs of others, capitalism works really well.<br /><br />I like to think that O&#39;Reilly is a great example of Yeoman Capitalism. We make our money by providing things that people pay us for, and I like to think we&#39;ve created more value for society than we&#39;ve captured for ourselves, which is how I think it ought to be. \u00a0(There is many a multi-billion dollar company whose founders told me they started with a couple of O&#39;Reilly books.)<br /><br />But it&#39;s not just small companies that can practice this kind of capitalism. The corporate structure and the &quot;joint stock company&quot; was a great invention: \u00a0a way to allocate resources for larger scale initiatives. \u00a0And there are still companies that use capital markets this way. \u00a0Amazon is a great example: \u00a0they have raised huge amounts of capital from financial markets and have used it to transform industries, providing huge amounts of consumer value in the process. Unlike, say Google, which was profitable without needing huge amounts of outside capital, Amazon has only been able to accomplish what is has with the aid of capital markets.<br /><br />I think many big companies start out this way, and only go wrong later in their lifecycle, when they are established, and their focus changes from innovation to preservation. \u00a0And that&#39;s where we get to Church&#39;s &quot;Corporate Capitalism.&quot;<br /><br />Church describes Corporate Capitalism as a kind of Feudalism, one in which the corporation is primarily concerned with self preservation and the perquisites of its executives, and co-opts government to give it unfair advantage. \u00a0That is entirely true,\u00a0but he doesn&#39;t explain how it came to be so. \u00a0<br /><br />Where this went off the rails was with the increased financialization of corporations. \u00a0There are at least three problems with this:<br /><br />1. Companies are often prevented from the market from taking risks and trying new things. \u00a0(Amazon is a stellar exception.) \u00a0I remember one entrepreneur telling me: \u00a0&quot;I can&#39;t do what I need to do to save my company. We&#39;re sitting on too much cash. If I invest in the future as I need to, it will depress the stock price, and we&#39;ll get acquired for our cash.&quot; \u00a0That was exactly what happened. \u00a0The company is no more.<br /><br />2. Things that serve real human needs but take too long to show financial results are abandoned. We see diseases that could be cured, but aren&#39;t, because there isn&#39;t enough money in it. \u00a0We see workers squeezed out to plump up profits, or not paid a living wage. (See\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonalds-employee-budget-has-everyone-up-in-arms/\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonalds-employee-budget-has-everyone-up-in-arms/</a>)\u00a0<br /><br />3. \u00a0Rather than being paid out of the actual earnings of the corporation, executives are largely rewarded based on the stock price. This leads both to outsized gains to executives, but also to a culture of manipulation of those prices, whether or not they are justified by the creation of real marketplace value. \u00a0And that, of course, is the basis for &quot;supercapitalism.&quot;<br /><br />Supercapitalism is the capitalism that brought us the mortgage crisis of 2009, the result of banks creating and selling financial instruments that were designed to fail. \u00a0It also brings news of recent shenanigans like Goldman Sachs&#39; manipulation of commodities markets. (See\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all</a>)<br /><br />There&#39;s a better term for this: \u00a0Looting, as described in a 1996 paper by George Akerlof and Paul Romer:<br /><br />&quot;\u2026the normal economics of maximizing economic value is replaced by the topsy-turvy economics of maximizing current extractable value, which tends to drive the firm&#39;s economic net worth deeply negative. Once owners have decided they can extract more from a firm by maximizing their present take, any action that allows them to extract more currently will be attractive--even if it causes a large reduction in the true economic net worth of the firm. \u00a0A dollar in increased dividends today is worth a dollar to owners, but a dollar in increased future earnings is worth nothing because future payments accrue to the creditors who will be left holding the bag.&quot;\u00a0<a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162</a><br /><br />That&#39;s supercapitalism in a nutshell.\u00a0\ufeff",

    "content": "This New Yorker piece by Atul Gawande has buried in it the solution to our under-employment crisis: stop focusing on financial outcomes for companies, and start focusing on results that make a better world.<br /><br />There are several accounts of extremely labor-intensive projects that have saved millions of lives (training in Bangladesh about how to treat cholera, given door-to-door, and a similar project in Uttar Pradesh to help counter infant mortality.)<br /><br />Gawande puts these projects in historical context by talking about how hard it was for the world to embrace hospital cleanliness as a life-saver, and the costs involved:<br /><br />&quot;Reactions that I\u2019ve heard both abroad and at home have been interestingly divided. The most common objection is that, even if it works, this kind of one-on-one, on-site mentoring \u201cisn\u2019t scalable.\u201d But that\u2019s one thing it surely is. If the intervention saves as many mothers and newborns as we\u2019re hoping\u2014about a thousand lives in the course of a year at the target hospitals\u2014then all that need be done is to hire and develop similar cadres of childbirth-improvement workers for other places around the country and potentially the world. To many people, that doesn\u2019t sound like much of a solution. It would require broad mobilization, substantial expense, and perhaps even the development of a new profession. But, to combat the many antisepsis-like problems in the world, that\u2019s exactly what has worked. Think about the creation of anesthesiology: it meant doubling the number of doctors in every operation, and we went ahead and did so. To reduce illiteracy, countries, starting with our own, built schools, trained professional teachers, and made education free and compulsory for all children. To improve farming, governments have sent hundreds of thousands of agriculture extension agents to visit farmers across America and every corner of the world and teach them up-to-date methods for increasing their crop yields. Such programs have been extraordinarily effective. They have cut the global illiteracy rate from one in three adults in 1970 to one in six today, and helped give us a Green Revolution that saved more than a billion people from starvation.&quot;<br /><br />It seems to me that rediscovering the kinds of tasks that require investing human capital to make real change are exactly the kinds of things we need to focus our economic energies on.<br /><br />Money and labor should follow the things that need doing, not be an end in itself, as it is so often in our distorted economy.\ufeff",

Author William Gibson liked it as well: <br /><br />&quot;A ravishing display of intelligent, often wonderfully witty visual design, every frame alive with coherent language, in the service of what is at heart a children\u2019s story. A children\u2019s story for a very dark time, our own, about a very dark time as children understand such things: monsters, from beneath the bed \u2014 our own or the ocean\u2019s! It restores heroism to the realm of the humanistic, an extraordinary accomplishment given so much of the film culture of our day. &quot;<br /><a href=\"http://digiphile.tumblr.com/post/55970297986/william-gibson-reviews-pacific-rim\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://digiphile.tumblr.com/post/55970297986/william-gibson-reviews-pacific-rim</a> <br /><br />Guillermo del Toro makes wonderful creatures. His films demonstrate genuine, deep abiding love for monsters, heroes and humanity.  <br /><br />If you&#39;ve seen this film, what did you think?\ufeff",

Minsky&#39;s ideas were applied to the Great Moderation in a 1995 paper by Steve Keen:<br /><br />From the NYT article:<br /><br />&quot;He suggested that lending standards would be gradually reduced, and asset prices would rise, as confidence grew that \u201cthe future is assured, and therefore that most investments will succeed.\u201d Eventually, the income-earning ability of an asset would seem less important than the expected capital gains. Buyers would pay high prices and finance their purchases with ever-rising amounts of debt.<br /><br />&quot;When something went wrong, an immediate need for liquidity would cause financiers to try to sell assets immediately. &#39;The asset market becomes flooded,&#39; Mr. Keen wrote, &#39;and the euphoria becomes a panic, the boom becomes a slump.&#39; Minsky argued that could end without disaster, if inflation bailed everyone out. But if it happened in a period of low inflation, it could feed upon itself and lead to depression.<br /><br />\u201c&#39;The chaotic dynamics explored in this paper,&#39; Mr. Keen concluded, &#39;should warn us against accepting a period of relative tranquillity in a capitalist economy as anything other than a lull before the storm.&#39;\u201d\ufeff",
